TODO by next meeting (10/8/2024):

1. Speech to text model research and implementation - **Rahul**

2. YouTube data api to download transcripts and videos.  Basically we try to download the transcript first and if it canâ€™t we catch an exception and then we download the video itself - **Rahul**

3. A process to use llm studio and the llama model to create embeddings and add them to qdrant - **Brody**

4. Copy and paste transcripts into LM Studio and see what kind of results you get for summaries and retrievals of things like names, concepts, or other information. We want a lot of smaller simpler prompts where we can validate that they return what we want. - **Humza**

5. Prompt Engineering: Use LM Studio to manually get responses from transcripts and come up with a process using python to do some kind of validation on the results.
(ex. asking it to find all the people in a transcript or something we can verify factually) - **Dylan**
